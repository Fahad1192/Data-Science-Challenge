# Data-Science-Challenge
Personal project on Airbnb dataset

We tried to answer different questions from Airbnb Berlin, London and Paris dataset. In first part, we tried to find answer to some questions related to Airbnb Berlin dataset by using Tableau (after preprocessing the data through Python and Excel). We tried to find out the relationship between seasonality and pricing.
Besides, tried to find out if any anomalous combination was present in the dataset in an attempt to handle any unwanted output.

In second part, we started with the feature selection and ranking the features according to their importance.

Then with the third part, where we made a comparison between Berlin, UK and Paris using regression.

In the final subpart of problem 3, we have tested a hypothesis in order to find out which city is more expensive between London and Paris.
